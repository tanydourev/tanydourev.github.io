                <p>Eco Domes is a project concept aimed at creating immersive public spaces with sustainable
                    integrations and accessibility for all age demographics. The domes are designed to be placed in
                    Queen
                    Victoria Park, located at the Niagara Falls waterfront on the Canadian side of the border. Utilizing
                    the benefits of
                    integrated greenery for oxygen reproduction, they provide a resting space for tourists and encourage
                    visitors to interact with public art.<br><br>

                <h2>INSPIRATIONS</h2>
                <p>The structure of the domes was inspired by four public design examples: the
                    <a href="https://architizer.com/projects/cellular-tessellation/">2014 "Cellular Tessellation"
                        pavilion</a> in Sydney, Australia; the <a
                        href="https://architizer.com/projects/hexalace/">Hexalace
                        building</a> in Mohali, India; the
                    <a href="https://www.laliveeventspaces.com/conga-room.html"> Conga Room</a> at the LA LIVE
                    nightclub
                    in Los Angeles, USA; and the interior of the <a href="https://archello.com/project/vista">Vista
                        Coffee
                        Shop</a> in Guangzhou, China.<br><br>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>A key element from all examples is the grid/honeycomb pattern used to form ceilings and exterior
                    supports. This was used on the roof of the domes, protecting the interior polycarbonate ceiling
                    while simultaneously creating interesting lighting patterns inside. The funnel form from the LA LIVE
                    nightclub was merged with the integrated greenery from the Vista Coffee Shop to create the nature
                    component that visitors can sit around.<br><br>

                <h2>CREATING THE STRUCTURE</h2>
                <p>Rhino 7's panelling tools were used in the creation of the hexagonal grid that covers
                    the roof of each dome. Between the grid is a polcarbonate dome to protect visitors from external
                    weather elements; this material has been used in greenhouses to regulate heat and would be
                    appropriate for days when sun exposure to the domes is at a high level. Layered sections on the
                    lower half have been added to improve air circulation within the structure, inviting a partial form
                    of privacy without being overly closed in.<br><br>All materials were
                    generated
                    using the Chaos V-Ray plugin for Rhino 7.<br><br>

                <h2>DOME LOCATION</h2>
                <p>During my initial research, I wanted to select a location that would maximize public interaction with
                    the domes and realized that there is no better place for this installation that an area that is at
                    the heart of Niagara Falls tourism: Queen Victoria Park. As a public park that tends to be heavily
                    populated by tourists year-round, it has varying uses based on the season. During the summer, it
                    becomes a picnic spot and play area for families in the summer; during the winter, it hosts the
                    annual Festival of Light and is home to several light displays. For certain events, the Niagara
                    Parks Commission will set up a stage for live performances, which always attracts large
                    crowds.<br><br>
