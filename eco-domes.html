                with sustainable integrations. The domes, designed to be placed in Queen Victoria Park at the Niagara
                Falls waterfront area, would provide a resting space for patrons while simulatenously utilizing the
                benefits of greenery for oxygen reproduction.

            <p class="project-text">The structure of the domes was inspired by four
                specific
                public design examples: the
                <a href="https://architizer.com/projects/cellular-tessellation/">2014 "Cellular Tessellation"
                    pavilion</a> in Sydney, Australia; the <a href="https://architizer.com/projects/hexalace/">Hexalace
                    building</a> in Mohali, India; the
                <a href="https://www.laliveeventspaces.com/conga-room.html"> Conga Room</a> at the LA LIVE
                nightclub
                in Los Angeles, USA; and the interior of the <a href="https://archello.com/project/vista">Vista
                    Coffee
                    Shop</a> in Guangzhou, China. Elements from each example were taken to form the prelimiary
                shapes of the domes, as well as influence colours, materials and natural integrations.<br><br>Rhino 7's
                panelling tools were used in the creation of the hexagonal grid that covers
                the roof of each dome. Layered sections were added on the lower half to ensure that air would be able to
                circulate in and out of the structure, inviting a partial form of privacy without being overly closed
                in. A polycarbonate dome would be placed underneath the hexagonal grid to protect from exterior weather
                elements, known for its durability and common usage in greenhouses.

            <p class="project-text">The location for the domes, Queen Victoria Park, is often used for different events
                based on the season. In the spring and summer, it becomes a picnic spot and play area for families. In
                the winter, it hosts light displays that are a part of the city's annual Festival of Lights. This space
                is located in an area that is heavily populated by tourists, making it accessible to all demographics
                who would be interested in interacting with the domes.<br><br><small>Satellite imagery courtesy of
