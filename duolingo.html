                    </p>
                    <p class="page-text"><b>Duolingo Notes</b> is a note-taking feature that simulates being able to make your own notes within the Duolingo app. It uses the same visual style and interactions as a basic notepad or notes app, as found on many mobile devices. Tags can be added to categorize notes, completely user-controlled and definable according to their needs. Not only does a note-taking system better help users retain learning material and reduces the need to redo lessons, but
                        also re-introduces habits that were present during their education.</p>

                    <p class="page-text"><b>Learning with Friends</b> expands the current system for using Duolingo with added friends. Although Duolingo allows you to connect with other users, there are limited interactions aside from app-controlled challenges/quests and maintaining a streak; conversely, having no friends on the app means users miss out on collaborative learning experiences. With the expanded system, users can now select custom challenges and invite their friends to
                        participate; healthy competition and rivalry is encouraged through a friends-only leaderboard.</p>

                    <p class="page-text">The feature also caters to users who don't have added friends, enabling the app's cast of characters to step forward as challenge/quest partners. The progress made by the appâ€™s characters would be dependent on their personalities. For example, Zari is depicted as a studious person who is eager to learn; she is more likely to contribute more to a quest than someone like Junior, who is depicted as a young child and easily distracted by other interests.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="page-text">Duolingo is a highly visual brand, relying on bright colours, rounded typography and shapes, cartoon-like characters and a sense of approachability that makes learning fun. Given I was designing the new features as an extension of what already exists, it was important to replicate the Duolingo interface as closely as possible. Although Duolingo's brand kit provided visual guidelines for its material, many interactive elements were designed by hand; layout
                        designs and placement of elements referenced screenshots of the app's Android version.</p>

                    <p class="page-text">The prototypes for Duolingo Notes and Learning with Friends were tested by a group of users who had existing knowledge of Duolingo and language learning apps. Each tester was given a series of tasks to complete using a combined Figma prototype with both features. The ease of use and any difficulties experiences were evaluated using a testing rubric with a section for notes/feedback; testing was done both syncronously and asyncronously, depending
                        on the availabilities of the tester.
                        <br><br>
                        Across both prototypes, opinions were highly positive with testers expressing interest in a possible implementation of the new features. Testers experienced near to no difficulties with Duolingo Notes; the only suggestion provided was to change the text input area to a box instead of per line. Greater difficulties were noted when toggling between the modes in Learning with Friends; feedback suggested a change in the design of the toggle, which would assist in the
                        ability to visually recognize and associate the element with switching modes.

                    <p class="page-text">Taking on the challenge to analyze Duolingo and language learning apps was one that I thoroughly enjoyed throughout the four-month span of this project. While my initial plans had been to improve on the learning content, I found myself more interested in suggesting improvements to features outside of the lessons that could still contribute to a more positive and engaging user experience. Through user feedback and testing, it was clear that learners view
                        Duolingo as a strong asset for learning languages; however, many felt that the app lacked a personalized touch and hindered their ability to customize their learning journeys. With the integrated notes system and more ways to learn with friends, the control is placed back into the users' hands; this was ultimately my bigger goal: <b>to help learners grow a passion for learning languages in a way that is engaging, intuitive and fun.</b></p>
