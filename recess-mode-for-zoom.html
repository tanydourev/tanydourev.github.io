                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        To begin, the team outlined criteria that would be used to determine whether participants were suited for the scope of our research study. We chose to target parents/guardians of elementary school students and teachers teaching at the elementary level. The children of parents/guardians had to be learning remotely from home; teachers were required to be teaching primarily using remote/digital methods.
                        <br><br>
                        A total of 10 participants (2 per researcher) provided consent to be part of the study. Interviews were conducted via digital methods in compliance with the public health guidelines and regulations set forth by Health Canada. In accordance with guidelines for ethical research set forth by the TCPS 2: CORE document and the Government of Canada, students and children under the legal age of 18 were excluded as participants due their classification as a "vulnerable
                        group".

                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        Using the data gathered from all ten participants, we created a theme analysis chart based on key information and topics that appeared recurringly through each interview. Seven categories of themes were identified:
                        </p>

                        <img class="grid-1" src="img/recess-mode-for-zoom/key-themes.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 25px;">

                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        Throughout the interviews, we noted the following recurring issues related to online learning and the effects of the pandemic on home life:
                    <ul style="padding-top: 10px;">
                        <li>Parents/guardians routinely noted changes in their children's behaviour and mental well-being as a result of limited interaction with peers.</li>
                        <li>Parents/guardians themselves were experiencing higher levels of stress (needing to help with homework more often, taking care of the family, going to work, etc).</li>
                        <li>Teachers struggled to maintain engagement and attention of students during class times.</li>
                        <li>Student success declined and motivation to learn decreased as social interaction was limited.</li>
                        <li>Some students benefited from learning in familiar environments, while others experienced difficulties adapting to computer software at such a young age.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        Additonally, each team member was responsible for creating an activity analysis chart based on scenarios that students go through using online learning methods. Breaking down the process helped us identify existing pain points with existing software and opportunities for improvement that we could emphasize with our solution.

                    <h3 class="section-title">Proposed Solution</h3>
                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        Our research highlighted a prominent theme that we elected to focus on with our solution: <b>the lack of interactivity between students and its long-term effects.</b> Since video call software such as Zoom was being predominantly used by school boards and teachers, we chose to design an integrated feature that would simulate virtual recess breaks and encourage the development of social skills between students.</b>
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Recess Mode</b>, as we called it, would help students transition back to a more social and interactive school schedule. Recess is essential for helping children learn to communicate with others and regulate emotions in social settings; removing this component from a regular learning day negatively impacts children in ways that is reflected in their home life. Instead of spending hours in front of screens with no break, students would be encouraged to interact with
                        peers
                        through a simulated virtual recess and engage in activities similar to ones that would occur during an in-person school day.

                    <h3 class="section-title">Design Requirements</h3>
                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        We outlined a set of design requirements for the Recess Mode feature that would take into consideration the limitations of Zoom as an existing software, the issues with technological literacy noted by parents/guardians and teachers, and regular recess activites that could be done remotely.

                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        Next, we created a user flow to determine possible interactions and the sub-interactions connected to each activity:

                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        A standard flow using Recess Mode works as follows:
                    <ul style="padding-top: 10px;">
                        <li>Teachers initiate Recess Mode through a button on their side of the group Zoom call.</li>
                        <li>The duration of "recess" is set by the teacher, which is reflected in the form of a timer on the student side.</li>
                        <li>Students are able to choose from a variety of teacher-approved activities, such as playing games, watching a movie, listening to music, chatting with friends, and drawing.</li>
                        <li>Five (5) minutes prior to the end of "recess", students receive a warning message and an audio signal in the form of a bell.</li>
                        <li>When "recess" ends, teachers end Recess Mode and students are brought back to the main part of the group Zoom call. Once again, an audio signal is provided to imitate a real recess-end bell.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        The original design for Recess Mode was created in Adobe XD during the initial timeline of the project. Since then, it has been redesigned in Figma according to Zoom's UI guidelines and visual standards outlined for the feature.

                        To simulate a 5-minute warning signal and the end of recess, we introduced an overlay concept that would combine with an audio component, such as a chime or bell. If a student requests help from a teacher, a "raise hand" button is available; this is similar to Zoom's counterpart, which informs the presenter/host that a participant has a question.

                        Recess Mode's visual identity encourages ease of use for children and draws from the playful nature of recess. As a team, we unanimously agreed that the interface would need to reflect the bright colours found in media that is education-related; classrooms also inspired us, as teachers often go above and beyond to foster welcoming environments for their students through decorating their rooms.
                        <br><br>
                        The original concept for the feature used an accent colour of turquoise (#99E6E0) in order to remain within the analagous colour range of Zoom's estbalished identity. With the re-design, Recess Mode makes use of orange (#F6953B) in the hopes of reflecting the vibrant and playful feeling that recess provides. To differentiate between activities, each activity has its respective colour scheme and mascot. Iconography and buttons are consistent throughout each screen; we
                        selected symbols that could be recognized and understood by younger demographics.
