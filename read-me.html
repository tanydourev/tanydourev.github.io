                <p class="text"><b>☆ミ</b></p>
                <br>
                <p class="text"><b>Surprise! You made it to the bonus page of this portfolio.</b> I wanted to tell a little story, shed some light on my life as a designer. I'm sure some of you can relate. If not, that's totally okay. I envy you just a little.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">The truth is, this isn't the first portfolio I've made.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">It's not the second.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">It's not the third.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">I've probably gone through over 15-20 iterations of remaking and re-designing this thing within the past three years.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">Why, you might ask? The answer is simple: imposter syndrome… well, that and having a crisis about my design abilities (that's normal though, right?).</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">When I first created my portfolio, it was for a course that I took in university. I thought my creation was unique back then, trying to go for a non-standard layout based on contained blog themes found on Tumblr. The accent image on the landing page was from a video game and there was a maximum of two project pages created, but hey, at least it was responsive. We didn't have to go too in-depth with the design; simply to generate an idea of what we wanted to start showcasing to the world. I vaguely recall getting a good mark on it, but I can't remember exactly what. To be fair, my professor gave off the impression at times that he didn't really want to sit through the portfolio presentations, so maybe it was decent.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">From there, the cycle began. Scrapping the old design, scouring Pinterest for inspiration, creating a new VS Code project titled “idea” or “new portfolio” or my favourite, “why”. Spending hours coding it, but not being happy with it after four days straight of staring at it. Deciding it wasn't good enough and starting fresh. Pinterest. Coding. Hating it. Pinterest. Behance. Coding. Hating that too. Realizing I'd spent more time remaking this portfolio than actually working on projects for it. Getting messages from friends saying “Portfolio, again?” with the response “Yeah, I had an idea”.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">The idea just wasn't good enough.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">After a while, I simply didn't know what to do. I felt like I was striving to create a portfolio that matched what professionals in the field were putting out, but the projects didn't reflect the same experience. I quite literally felt like an imposter, questioning my own abilities, wondering why I never felt happy with it. I tried so many styles - minimalism, cyber, elegant serif, Japanese graphic design, big and bold, Apple UI, everything… yet, nothing stuck. I was in an endless loop of seeing something that I liked and hoping that it would seem cool enough to catch the eye of someone in the field. I've always known that I'm too self-critical of my work at times, but this felt like a search for perfection that was mentally draining me the longer I looked.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">Ironically, a typeface inspired this design. I've always liked fonts and letters. <i>Inter</i> is probably my favourite sans-serif out there. I've used it many times on portfolios and designs, including this one. It was actually <i>Kilimanjaro</i> that sparked a new idea in my head though. Honestly, I'm really not sure how; I just found it somewhere online and saw the graphics for it and thought “hey, this is pretty cool”. Downloaded it, messed around with some colours and now I'm here, with a proper, finished portfolio design that I'm proud of.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">The point is, the portfolio process never ends. It's always going to be something that I'll work on and try to fine-tune. Who knows, maybe I'll end up re-designing this yet again (although I'm secretly hoping that I don't); at least I've gotten better at hard-coding websites over the years. Having imposter syndrome about your abilities as a designer and your work is a creativity killer. There even came a point where I wondered if I'd made a mistake studying design and basing my career upon a field that was so competitive to begin with. What if I'd gone into business? Or even something science-related? I've always liked space, it could work if I just brush up on my math skills. But no, I'm still here.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">I’m happy with how far I’ve come. Yes, it’s been tough to create something that I’m proud of, but it’s helped me to better understand who I am as a designer and what I want the world to know about me. I’ve started being able to craft an identity for myself - one that isn’t based on what others have done or can do, but rather one that plays off my personality and the parts of it that I bring into my work. As much as I like my clean minimalistic designs, they’re too bland for who I am. Cyber aesthetics are cool, but they don’t work if I’m trying to show off a pet brand with happy doggos and kitties. Sometimes, Pinterest doesn’t provide us with the right inspiration and that’s okay.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">Keep designing. That’s what I tell myself. Maybe not so much in the context of always changing the portfolio, but you’ll feel it when the spark hits and you just <i>know</i> that this is it. This is the portfolio that you like and the version of yourself that feels right for the world to see.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">I’ve remade this thing many times, but it’s made me better. Maybe I'll finally have time now to finish all those projects I started and never finished... ^-^</p>
