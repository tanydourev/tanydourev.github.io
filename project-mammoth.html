                <p class="overview"><b>Project Mammoth</b> is an interactive hologram installation designed by Brock
                    University's Project Mammoth student team. The installation is based on biodiversity loss and the
                    impact of human activies on marine species, aiming to providing a unique educational experience for
                    all ages. Combining hologram technology with audio/visual and motion components, it encourages
                    educators to consider new methods of presenting critical topics that would keep viewers more engaged
                    than a traditional lecture or seminar.<br><br>This installation is the first project of its kind to
                    be created in Brock
                    University's Interactive Arts & Sciences program. It was put together by a team of twelve third-year
                    students over a span of eight months and displayed in the university's Digital Scholarship Lab. I
                    was appointed project lead for the installation and was part of the modelling team for asset
                    creation.</p>

                <h2>CONCEPT ORIGINS</h2>
                <p class="regular-text" style="color: #151515;">The idea to create a hologram installation as part of an
                    interactive project stemmed from videos of DIY holograms using a phone and part of a plastic CD
                    case. I never had the opportunity to put one together myself, however I thought it would be
                    interesting to see whether this makeshift version could be scaled up for an educative purpose. Along
                    with the members of Project Mammoth, we worked together to brainstorm different topics that would
                    benefit from a visual approach; unanimously, it was ageed upon that biodiversity loss was something
                    we all felt passionate about to create a project for.<br><br>Our research took us into a different
                    direction than was originally expected with such a topic. Instead of focusing solely on endangered
                    marine species that were well-known, we selected additional animals that were less spoken about by
                    the media and environmental groups, such as the blue-footed booby and the <i>acropora
                        jacquelinae</i> coral. We felt it was
                    important to note that biodiversity loss was more serious than most people are aware of, hence our
                    decision to dig deeper. By the end of our research period, the team had selected a total of eight
                    unique animals.</p>

                <h2>MODELLING & ASSET CREATION</h2>
                <p class="regular-text" style="color: #151515;">One of the key components of the installation was
                    creating 3D models of each animals that we'd chosen to showcase. The modelling team, which consisted
                    of myself and three other members, selected a low-poly modelling style that would appear friendly
                    and playful, while simultaneously allowing us to add physical details and markings that were unique
                    to each animal. Each model was created and textured in Blender, then rendered for the project's
                    website and design document in a high quality format. I created four of the eight animal
                    models: the African penguin, the striped smooth hound shark, the <i>acropora jacquelinae</i> coral,
                    and the Arctic polar bear.<br><br>For the visual component of the hologram, the modelling team
                    experimented with several variations of environment styles that would work best with the plexiglass
                    prism we intended to create for the reflections. We felt it
                    would be more beneficial in communicating our message of awareness if habitats were included, as
                    biodiversity loss often begins with the destruction of such areas. It was decided that the
                    environments would mimic small domes or "terrariums", and would open to reveal the associated
                    animal. Each member of the modelling team created the environment for their respective animals, then
                    passed it along to me for rendering in the video format that would be used for the hologram.

                <h2>INTERACTIVE COMPONENTS & SOUND</h2>
                <p class="regular-text" style="color: #151515;">Interactivity was a part of the project that we had to
                    refine through several iterations. It was already known that the hologram would require sound of
                    some sort, which we achieved through educational narration about each animal and custom audio tracks
                    mixed together by members of the sound team. However, one of our biggest issues stemmed from the
                    question of how to combine the visuals and audio with our planned interactive component ‚Äî a motion
                    sensor that would allow viewers to switch to the next animals using gestures. After several
                    troubleshooting sessions and endless debugging, the coding team was able to create a Python program
                    that communicated with a Raspberry Pi and Flick motion sensor board. The program would pull from an
                    array of videos that we created to work according to the reflective physics of the plexiglass prism;
                    all narration and music would already be integrated into the videos to lighten the load on the
                    Python program.<br><br>The Flick motion sensor was operated using four simple air-based gestures:
                    swipe to the right to go to the next animal; swipe to the left to go to the previous animal; swipe
                    upwards to increase the volume; swipe down to decrease the volume. We decided to stick to these
                    gestures in order to avoid issues with the motion sensor deciphering movements incorrectly, as well
                    as to allow younger viewers to be able to operate the hologram as easily as possible.

                <h2>PROJECT BRANDING</h2>
                <p class="regular-text" style="color: #151515;">Project Mammoth's branding was created by members of the
                    branding team, and was designed to encapsulate a playful approach to the installation. We envisioned
                    our project as something that would cater to audiences of all ages, so we wanted our branding to
                    share the message that education was for everyone. Upon initial feedback and review of our project
                    concept, the question was raised of why a mammoth was chosen as part of the logo and project name,
                    despite it not being a marine animal. Mammoths are well-known for being a species that went extinct
                    shortly after the Earth transitioned out of the Ice Age, however some scientists believe the mammal
                    was lost due to additional pressure of human hunting. The animals we chose for the project are
                    facing endangerment for similar reasons as the mammoth ‚Äî habitat loss through global warming and
                    human involvement. It serves as a warning that if humanity continues to disregard its impact on
                    nature, the animals we share the planet with will face the same fate as mammoths did all those years
                    ago.
