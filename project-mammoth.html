                <p>Project Mammoth is an interactive installation about endangered marine species that combines hologram
                    technology with audio/visual and motion components. It aims to provide
                    a unique educational experience for all ages and encourages educators to considers new methods of
                    presenting information on critical topics such as biodiversity loss and the impact of human presence
                    on nature.<br><br>This installation is the first project of its kind to be created in Brock
                    University's Interactive Arts & Sciences program. It was put together by a team of twelve third-year
                    students over a span of eight months and displayed in the university's Digital Scholarship Lab
                    throughout the 2021/22 exam period.<br><br>

                <h2>CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
                <p>Throughout the duration of this project, I was appointed the team lead and became part of the
                    modelling team. I ensured the group worked according to the production schedule generated during the
                    planning phase, was involved in creating process documentation for all assets in the installation,
                    and acted as a bridge between faculty and students for communications.<br><br>My role as a modeller
                    involved creating four of the eight animal models: the African penguin, the striped smooth hound
                    shark, the acropora jacquelinae coral, and the Arctic polar bear. Each model was created in Blender using a low-poly style; texture
                    painting was used to emphasize key details or markers on the body.<br><br>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I worked on creating several environments to
                    showcase their habitats, in addition to video-based renders that would be displayed on the
                    hologram's plexiglass prism. Myself and the modelling team experimented with several iterations of the environments, but ultimately found that the dome shape would fit best with the projection of the image onto the prism.<br><br>
