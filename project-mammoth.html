                <b>Project Mammoth</b> is an interactive hologram installation designed by Brock University's Project
                Mammoth
                student team. The installation is based on biodiversity loss and the impact of human activies on marine
                species, aiming to providing a unique educational experience for all ages. Combining hologram technology
                with audio/visual and motion components, it encourages educators to consider new methods of presenting
                critical topics that would keep viewers more engaged than a traditional lecture or seminar.<br><br>

                This installation is the first project of its kind to be created in Brock University's Interactive Arts
                & Sciences program. It was put together by a team of twelve third-year students over a span of eight
                months and displayed in the university's Digital Scholarship Lab. I was appointed project lead/manager
                for the
                installation and was part of the modelling team for asset creation.

            <h3>Origins & research</h3>
            <p class="page-text">
                The idea to create a hologram installation was based on videos of DIY holograms designed from plastic CD
                cases and a phone. Our team decided it would be an interesting experiment to see whether we could
                replicate the effects on a larger scale and integrate interactive elements. When selecting our topic for
                the installation, we all believed biodiversity loss would be a good starting point in order to prove
                that holograms served both an educational and interactive purpose. Instead
                of focusing solely on endangered marine species that were well-known, we selected animals that were less
                spoken about by the media and environmental groups, such as the blue-footed booby and the
                <i>acropora jacquelinae</i> coral. We felt it was important to note that biodiversity loss was more
                serious
                than society was aware of, as most conservation efforts are generalized and the popularity of certain
                animals overshadows others.
            </p>

            <h3>Modelling & assets</h3>
            <p class="page-text">One of the key components of the installation was creating 3D models of the animals we
                chose to showcase. The modelling team, which consisted of myself and three other members, selected a
                low-poly style that was friendly and playful, while simultaneously allowing us to add physical details
                and markings that were unique to each animal. Each model was created and textured in Blender, then
                rendered for the project's website and design document using Cycles.</p>

            <p class="page-text" style="margin-top: 35px;">For the visual component of the hologram, the team decided to
                create environmental
                models for each animal. We felt it would be more beneficial in communicating our message of awareness if
                habitats were included, as biodiversity loss often begins with the destruction of such areas. The
                environments mimicked small domes or "terrariums", and opened to reveal the associated
                animal. In order for the physics of the hologram to work, the animated domes were rendered
                in video format from all four sides, then combined alongside narration and sound.</b>

            <h3>Interactive components</h3>
            <p class="page-text">Interactivity was a part of the project that we refined through several
                iterations. In order for viewers to operate the hologram, it had to receive a form of input that would
                tell the Python program to switch the visuals to the next animal — this was achieved through the use of
                a Raspberry Pi and a Flick motion sensor. The sensor was activated through gesture-based motions,
                such as moving one's hand to the right for the next visual. Using familiar gestures that mimic how we
                interact with other forms of media (ex. swiping right on a phone to see the next photo) meant younger
                audiences would also be able to interact with the hologram in a simple manner and it would lessen the
                confusion on how the sensor board itself worked.</p>

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p class="page-text">
                Project Mammoth's branding was designed to encapsulate a playful approach to the installation. We
                envisioned our project as something that would cater to audiences of all ages and encouraged education,
                as opposed to presenting itself solely as a hologram experiment.</p>

            <p class="page-text">The decision to select a mammoth as the logo for Project Mammoth served as a direct
                reference to the fates
                of endangered animals. While mammoths are not classified as marine species, they are known for becoming
                extinct due to habitat loss after the Ice Age and increased pressure from human hunting. If humanity
                continues to ignore its impact on nature, both the marine species we showcased and all other animals we
                share the planet with will share the same fate as mammoths did. The logo concept was questioned during
                our
                feedback sessions, however the team felt strongly that it represented our interest in raising awareness.
