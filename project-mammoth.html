    </h1>

    <div id="page-text">
        <p><b>Project Mammoth</b> is an interactive hologram installation designed by Brock University's Project Mammoth
            student team. The installation is based on biodiversity loss and the impact of human activies on marine
            species, aiming to providing a unique educational experience for all ages. Combining hologram technology
            with audio/visual and motion components, it encourages educators to consider new methods of presenting
            critical topics that would keep viewers more engaged than a traditional lecture or seminar.
            <br><br>
            I was appointed project lead/manager for the installation and was part of the modelling team for asset
            creation. The project is the first of its kind to be created in Brock University's Interactive Arts &
            Sciences program. It was put together by a team of twelve third-year students over a span of eight months
            and displayed in the university's Digital Scholarship Lab.

        <h2>Origins & Research</h2>
        <p>The idea to create a hologram installation was based on videos of DIY holograms designed from plastic CD
            cases and a phone. Our team decided it would be an interesting experiment to see whether we could replicate
            the effects on a larger scale and integrate interactive elements. When selecting our topic for the
            installation, we all believed biodiversity loss would be a good starting point in order to prove that
            holograms served both an educational and interactive purpose. Instead of focusing solely on endangered
            marine species that were well-known, we selected animals that were less spoken about by the media and
            environmental groups, such as the blue-footed booby and the acropora jacquelinae coral. We felt it was
            important to note that biodiversity loss was more serious than society was aware of, as most conservation
            efforts are generalized and the popularity of certain animals overshadows others.

    <div id="page-text">
        <h2>Modelling & Assets</h2>
        <p>One of the key components of the installation was creating 3D models of the animals we chose to showcase. The
            modelling team, which consisted of myself and three other members, selected a low-poly style that was
            friendly and playful, while simultaneously allowing us to add physical details and markings that were unique
            to each animal. Each model was created and textured in Blender, then rendered for the project's website and
            design document using Cycles.

            <p>The African penguin is a currently listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened
                Species. Their main threats are lack of food from overfishing and climate change. Since 1978,
                the population has dropped more than 50%.</p>

        <p>For the visual component of the hologram, the team decided to create environmental models for each animal. We
            felt it would be more beneficial in communicating our message of awareness if habitats were included, as
            biodiversity loss often begins with the destruction of such areas. The environments mimicked small domes or
            "terrariums", and opened to reveal the associated animal. In order for the physics of the hologram to work,
            the animated domes were rendered in video format from all four sides, then combined alongside narration and
            sound.

        <h2>Interactive Components</h2>
        <p>Interactivity was a part of the project that we refined through several iterations. In order for viewers to
            operate the hologram, it had to receive a form of input that would tell the Python program to switch the
            visuals to the next animal ‚Äî this was achieved through the use of a Raspberry Pi and a Flick motion sensor.
            The sensor was activated through gesture-based motions, such as moving one's hand to the right for the next
            visual. Using familiar gestures that mimic how we interact with other forms of media (ex. swiping right on a
            phone to see the next photo) meant younger audiences would also be able to interact with the hologram in a
            simple manner and it would lessen the confusion on how the sensor board itself worked.

    <div id="page-text">
        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>Project Mammoth's branding was designed to encapsulate a playful approach to the installation. We envisioned
            our project as something that would cater to audiences of all ages and encouraged education, as opposed to
            presenting itself solely as a hologram experiment.

    <div id="page-text" style="margin-top: 25px;">
        <p>The decision to select a mammoth as the logo for Project Mammoth served as a direct reference to the fates of endangered animals. While mammoths are not classified as marine species, they are known for becoming extinct due to habitat loss after the Ice Age and increased pressure from human hunting. If humanity continues to ignore its impact on nature, both the marine species we showcased and all other animals we share the planet with will share the same fate as mammoths did. The logo concept was questioned during our feedback sessions, however the team felt strongly that it represented our interest in raising awareness.
