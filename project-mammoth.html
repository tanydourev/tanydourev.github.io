            <p class="project-text"><b>PROJECT MAMMOTH</b> is an interactive hologram installation about endangered
                marine species around the world. It integrates hologram technology with audio/visual and motion
                components, aiming to provide a unique educational experience that all age demographics can enjoy.
                Additionally, it encourages educators to approach new ways of presenting information about critical
                topics in a world where digital methods have become highly effective.<br><br>As the appointed project
                lead, I was responsible for managing a team of twelve designers, ensuring the group worked according to
                the production schedule generated during the planning phase, and acting as a bridge between faculty and
                students for communications. I was heavily involved in modelling the marine animals we showcased, as
                well as making environments and setting up camera animations for each render.<br><br>Project Mammoth is
                the first project of its kind to be created in Brock University's Interactive Arts & Sciences program.

            <p class="project-text">The contents of the installation were modelled in Blender using low-poly techniques. We selected eight marine animals to showcase: the African penguin, the striped smooth hound shark, the blue-footed booby, the Espanola marine iguana, the North Atlantic right whale, the acropora jacquelinae coral, the Hawksbill sea turtle, and the polar bear.<br><br>My role as a modeller involved creating four of the eight animal models, in addition to several environments to showcase their habitats. In order to properly apply the physics of holograms to our installation, each animation was then prepared in a video format that would allow for additional adjustments according to the plexiglass prism being used.
