                <p class="text">As part of my journey to explore UX design in mobile apps, I was inspired to create a concept that would combine music with the simplicity of <a href="https://bereal.com/en/">BeReal</a>. The French photo-sharing app gained traction for the authenticity in its goal: to remove the "fakeness" of social media and share in-the-moment snapshots of daily life. I was passionate about seeing how this approach could extend to music, and how users could be encouraged to
                    contribute to something that didn't rely on algorithms or curated profiles.</p>

                <p class="text">I began by conducting market research on existing music-sharing apps and music-streaming platforms to identify how users interact with each other. Sharing music in the style of BeReal (one song per day) was much less popular than sending a link or sharing to a social media app; however, there were two apps that stood out:</p>

                        <p class="text">After an extended period of time, many users found BeReal to be too repetitive and boring. <span style="color: #A6A6A6">They felt the moments being shared from their lives were "too mundane" compared to others.</span></p>

                        <p class="text">The removal of the "Memories" feature prevented users from accessing past moments shared with friends/family. <span style="color: #A6A6A6">Unless the photos were saved to the device's local storage, they couldn't be recovered.</span></p>

Simultaneously, it faced the challenge of emphasizing user friendliness and learning from BeReal's biggest mistake: removing the ability to look back to the past.</p>

                    <li>[ 1 ] Allow users to share music with others.</li>

                <p class="text">Muji is designed to bring exposure to new and upcoming artists; a true wingman in the world of music. App stores on both Android and iOS are oversaturated with music player apps, which renders Muji's goal obsolete if it were marketed as such. Instead, Muji provides the ability for users to hear snippets of songs; full tracks can be played via the preferred music-streaming service of choice. This way, artists are supported by streams of their music in places where
                    their songs have been uploaded and are licensed to be played. Muji is simply the monkey in the middle.</p>

                <p class="text">Three levels of fidelity were used to generate the wireframes and mockup screens: base wireframe (white/gray, placeholders); structured wireframe (dark gray/black, more text elements); and integrated mockup (with photos, buttons, links). I wanted to incorporate the simplicity of BeReal's UI, while simultaneously drawing from the structure of Spotify and Apple Music; VSCO's UI was also a point of inspiration its minimalistic design.</p>

                <p class="text" style="margin-bottom: -15px;">Simplifications were made on the Home screen; instead of relying on a scroll-first page, I divided the content into three individual sections that could be accessed via buttons at the top. Songs shared by friends were moved to the Home screen, while the Friends screen focused primarily on friends lists. The "leaderboards" element on the Community screen was removed in the final design; while I considered it to be a fun way of seeing
                    how active users are from
                    different parts of the world, I opted for its removal as it would require access to location data and I believed a music-sharing app wouldn't require this permission.</p>
