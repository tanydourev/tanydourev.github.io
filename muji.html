                <p class="project-page-text">As part of my journey to explore UX design in mobile apps, I was inspired to create a concept that would combine music with the simplicity of <a href="https://bereal.com/en/">BeReal</a>, a French photo-sharing app. BeReal gained traction for the authenticity in its goal: to remove the "fakeness" of social media and share in-the-moment snapshots of daily life. I was passionate about seeing how this approach could extend to music, and how users
                    could be encouraged to contribute to
                    something that didn't rely on algorithms or curated profiles.

                    <h3 class="section-title">Market Research</h3>
                    <p class="project-page-text">To begin, I conducted market research on existing music-sharing apps and music-streaming platforms to identify how users interact with each other. Sharing music in the style of BeReal — one song per day — was much less popular than sending a link or sharing to a social media app; however, there were two apps that stood out:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="padding-top: 10px; width: 100%;">

                            <li>Created by MySound Inc. / 2022 / iOS only.</li>
                            <li>Users share one song per day based on a theme.</li>
                            <li>A "fire" reaction can be given to show approval of song choices made by friends.</li>
                        </ul>

                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="project-page-text">
                        Both apps had very few reviews and downloads compared to streaming giants, which can be attributed to the following factors: lack of funding or resources for development; being overshadowed by more popular music apps; or the app's theme is not as popular with users than expected.
                        <br><br>
                        Major music-streaming services provide a feature for users to share songs directly to other social media platforms. This is done via a card/widget that contains the song title, artist and cover art; the UI style varies from app to app, as seen below:

                    <h3 class="section-title">Breaking Down BeReal</h3>
                    <p class="project-page-text">Given BeReal was a highly influential part of developing Muji’s concept, I wanted to understand what drew users to it as opposed to other social media apps. I started by analyzing its functionality as a photo-sharing platform; based on reviews from users, I identified four key issues:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="padding-top: 10px;">
                        <li><b>After an extended period of time, many users found BeReal to be too repetitive and boring.</b> They felt the moments being shared from their lives were "too mundane" compared to others.</li>

                        <li><b>The removal of the "Discovery" feature isolated users from the rest of the world.</b> They no longer felt connected to others when they couldn't see what was being shared.</li>

                        <li><b>The removal of the "Memories" feature prevented users from accessing past moments shared with friends/family.</b> Unless the photos were saved to the device's local storage, there was no way to recover them.</li>

                        <li><b>The app itself is not optimized for mobile devices and users experienced several technical issues.</b> Frequent problems with notifications, camera access and in-app functions were reported.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <br><br>
                <div class="div-line-2"></div>

                <!-- the problem -->
                <div id="project-page">
                    <h3 class="section-title">The Problem</h3>
                    <p class="project-page-text">Using the information gathered from my market research and analyzing BeReal, I drafted the following problem statement: <b>How can we encourage people to share music in a collaborative way?</b> Considering popular music-streaming services hold positions of monopoly over the industry, Muji needed to emphasize user friendliness and functionality to stand out amongst its competitors.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <br><br>
                <div class="div-line-2"></div>

                <div id="project-page">
                    <h3 class="section-title">The User Process</h3>
                    <p class="project-page-text">The first step to tackling my problem question was defining what a user could do with Muji and possible interactions through the form of a user flow:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <img class="grid-1" src="img/muji/user-flow.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 25px;">

                <p class="project-page-text">One of the interactions available to users is being able to preview a song shared by others or on a playlist. During the planning phase, I outlined my intent to avoid turning Muji into a music-playing app; instead, I wanted the focus to be on sharing songs and collaboration. Previews would give users the opportunity to hear snippets of songs, but would ultimately hear the full track on their preferred music-streaming service if the song is featured in
                    an exported playlist. In turn, artists would also be supported by streams and plays of their music on platforms where their songs have been uploaded — Muji is simply the middle man.</p>

                <div id="project-page">
                    <h3 class="section-title">Wireframes to Final Concept</h3>
                    <p class="project-page-text">Using the user flow as a guideline, I generated two levels of wireframes and a final mockup. While transitioning between versions, I found myself removing and re-adjusting elements with each level of fidelity. I wanted to incorporate the simplicity of BeReal's UI, while simultaneously drawing from the structure of Spotify and Apple Music.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <img class="grid-1" src="img/muji/muji-wireframes.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 25px;">

                <p class="project-page-text">Notably, simplifications were made on the Home screen; instead of relying on a scroll-first page, I divided the content into three individual sections that could be accessed via buttons at the top. Songs shared by friends were moved to the Home screen, while the Friends screen focused primarily on friends lists. The "leaderboards" element on the Community screen was removed in the final design; while I considered it to be a fun way of seeing how
                    active users are from different parts of the world, I opted for its removal as it would require access to location data.</p>

                    <p class="project-page-text">Muji's visual identity and UI incorporates dark themes and an accent colour of peach-red (#DB504A). The logo combines two variations of eighth notes: a regular note and a beamed note. The bridge that forms the beamed note also forms the letter 'M', standing for Muji.
