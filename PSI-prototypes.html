                    <p class="design-challenge">How can we use design to create adoption opportunities for
                        senior animals and support pet owners by providing better access to caretaking resources?</b>
                    </p>
                    <p class="page-text">Senior cats and dogs have long been subjected to reputations as loving companions who are the last to leave shelters, with adoptability rates being significantly lower than their younger counterparts (Afonso et al., 2024; Hawes et al., 2018; Lampe et al., 2015; Markowitz, 2019). Although these animals are documented to provide significant health benefits for humans (Putney, 2012; Sable, 2013), many adopters are still hesitant to take on the challenge of
                        caring for an older pet due to factors such as existing medical conditions, shorter lifespans, and prior
                        sociability with other pets/children (Hawes et al., 2018). As a result, extended stays in shelters demoralize adopting prospects and negatively impact the health of senior animals (Dybdall et al., 2014; Workman et al., 2015; Hawes et al., 2018).</p>

                    <p class="page-text">In 2021, Humane Canada recorded an intake of over 81,000 animals (2021) ‚Äî with such high levels of competition for adopter attention, it comes to no surprise that senior animals struggle to be noticed amidst such numbers. For many adopters, having this variety of choices can be a challenge for senior animals, who are already disadvantaged due to their age.<br><br>
                        Unlike younger animals, there are more factors affecting the adoptability of senior animals:</p>

                    <p class="bold-title">Creating a senior animal adoption service.</p>
                    <p class="page-text">Many commercial adoption services promote senior animals on their platforms, but there is no dedicated adoption service that solely targets this age demographic. This provides a unique opportunity to create a space where greater attention can be placed on senior animals, offering support for their needs and encouraging adopters to consider older companions while simultaneously aiding shelters in improving the intake-to-adoption conversion. The
                        service will also be supported by user research derived from pet owners, adopters, and animal shelters, emphasizing the importance of addressing user needs.
                        <br><br>
                        Through a needs analysis, the following user needs and pain points were identified, which guided the development of the prototypes:

                    <p class="page-text">The user flow is designed to be a mid-level overview of how a user would interact with the homepage of the senior animal adoption service. It highlights the primary functions and interactions with additional details, but represents only a small portion of the full interactions available. The intention for the service is to provide a space where senior animals can be viewed and adopted, and to create a hub for pet owners looking to find information on
                        adopting senior animals. Many adopters also feel that they are not equipped with the proper
                        knowledge to care for a senior animal; having a reputable and trustworthy source of caretaking information can help ease the worries of adopters and encourage them to make informed adoption decisions.</p>

                    <p class="page-text">The storyboard scenario provides a glimpse into how a user would interact with the service as a whole ‚Äì this includes the desktop website, the mobile app, and associated social media networks. I felt that including the different platforms on which the service would be available or would display information on better represented ways in which a user would access it.
                        <br><br>
                        Through Miro, I brainstormed the different aspects of the storyboard that I wanted to focus on, such as the issues/pain points, user motivations, and feelings. This planning was then turned into a storyboard using StoryTribe that features a user named Alexis who uses the adoption service to find a senior cat at a local shelter.

                    <p class="page-text">The design of the interface draws inspiration from existing animal adoption services such as <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/">Petfinder</a> and <a href="https://www.adoptapet.com/">Adopt a Pet</a>. Given my storyboard scenario features the user coming across a post about Senior Pet Awareness Month, I felt it would be important to include this somehow in the artefact, since many animals shelters and organizations tend to promote senior animal adoptions
                        during this month and are able to direct adopter interest to this age demographic. The decision to feature ‚Äúlong-timers‚Äù on the homepage aims to help animals who have been listed the longest to find homes faster, as prior research shows that animal health and well-being decreases as the time they spend in a shelter increases.
                        <br><br>
                        The voice and language used within the interface for this artefact is playful, yet simple and clear. When researching existing animal adoption services, I noticed that Adopt a Pet made use of clever puns and phrases associated with pets (ex. displaying ‚ÄúSit! Stay! We're fetching our four-legged friends‚Äù as the page loads search results). I wanted to incorporate this sense of humour while ensuring that the copy was straightforward for users and wasn‚Äôt overly reliant on pet
                        puns (ex. the ‚ÄúTabby Tidbits‚Äù section title, the descriptions of the featured help articles).
